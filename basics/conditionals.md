# Conditionals

Conditionals are very useful because they allow use to execute different instructions based on a boolean condition. Conditionals can also be nested to create complex instructions and branches.&#x20;

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```sml
if 10 > 2 then true else false
if null? then println("Is null") else println("Not null :)")
```
{% endcode %}
