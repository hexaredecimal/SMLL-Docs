### Welcome

Welcome to the official documentation for the SMLL programming language. I hope you look forward to exploring different ways of writing programs for the JVM. I assume you are familiar with the JAVA programming language. If you are a complete beginner this reading is still fine for you, but you are most likely not going to appreciate the use cases of the concepts presented in this document. Lets get started with the SMLL programming language and write JVM applications using an easy and maintainable programming language.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
SMLL is not meant to replace the official programming languages for the JVM, especially JAVA, this will never happen, EVER!. SMLL is just a hobby language that I came up with for myself by myself. Don't expect features you love from JAVA to be present, if so just use JAVA.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Project

The SMLL project is hosted on [github](https://github.com/hexaredecimal/ML). Contributions are allowed given that they add or fix a bug.&#x20;
